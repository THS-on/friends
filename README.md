# Friends
This repository is a place for members of the ecosystem (known as "Keylime Friends") to self-report how they use [Keylime](https://keylime.dev).

Knowing which individuals and companies are involved in Keylime and why is beneficial to the entire Keylime community, the stories should be written with this in mind.

To make an entry (thank you!), please create a directory for your organisation and add a markdown file. Please see `example` for an outline. Make this a pull
request to [keylime/friends](https://github.com/keylime/friends/)
